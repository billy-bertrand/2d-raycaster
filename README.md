# Description

A simple 2D ray caster. Light rays are emitted from a single light source, in every direction. I was inspired by the Coding train's thumbnail on the matter. So I decided to build my own version. I also wanted to understand what a game loop is, and undergo the research process to build one.

# Result :)

# How to run the code

After cloning the repository, run the following commands in your terminal:

    make build
    make run
    make clean

*I would like to bring to your attention that I was working on Ubuntu, and had **CMake** and **SDL** installed on my local machine.*
